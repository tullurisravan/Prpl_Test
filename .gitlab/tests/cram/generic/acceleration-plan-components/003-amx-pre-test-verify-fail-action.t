Create R alias:

  $ alias R="${CRAM_REMOTE_COMMAND:-}"

  $ R logger -t cram "Starting with amx-processmonitoring pre-checks"

Ensure ProcessMonitor.Test.i.FailAction does not have REBOOT action:

  $ R "ba-cli -l ProcessMonitor.Test.*.FailAction\? | "\
  > "grep -vE '(RESTART|NONE)' | sed '/^$/d'"

Verify any process monitoring failures observed before starting with tests:
Exclude prplmesh, wifi-sensing and pwhm checks till FEAT-27 is merged:
Exclude wifi-scheduler PPW-1679:

  $ R "grep \"amx-processmonitor: process - \[!\]Test.*failed too often,"\
  > " executing action\" /var/log/messages* /var/log/messagess.? 2>/dev/null" \
  > "| grep -vE '(prplmesh|wifi-sensing|wifi-scheduler|wld)' || true"

  $ R logger -t cram "Pre-checks for amx-processmonitoring tests completed"
